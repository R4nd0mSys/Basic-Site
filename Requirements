Design a website for the Tourism Sites of a given City. There should be at least 15 web-pages present in the web-site. There should be:

## 1. One Home page that leads to other pages. The Home page should contain the name of the City as heading along with a logo. There should be a tab

with the following links:

            a. Home;

            b. Heritage;

            c. Hotel Booking;

            d. Gallery.

There should be an appropriate description of the college on the home page.

## 2. One Heritage page which contains a list of all the Heritage Sites present in the city. The list should be a list of Pictures. There should be a minimum of ten heritage sites. Each Image entry in the list should be a HTML link/button that leads to a web-page totally dedicated to the Heritage Site itself.

3. Each Heritage Site should have its own dedicated web-page. This page should contain a description about the site along with its history. 

## 4. The Hotel Booking page basically contains a form that a person needs to fill up in order to stay in a hotel. The form should ask all the necessary

questions using appropriate form elements. 

## 5. One gallery page that contains set of photos taken of the Heritage Sites throughout the city.

Please note that each web-page in this website should have the same background Image/color. The looks of each page should be similar.
